Project Two General Assembly Boston SEI03

Title of Project: "Hangout Boston"

Technologies Used Include: -Ruby, Ruby on Rails, Postgresql

Planning:

-My original planning started with creating my wireframe and ERD based off of what I wanted my SPA to look like. However, as many new developers learn, things do not always go to plan. When I first began the Hangout Boston Project, I built my back end database first. I was able to migrate everything the way I wanted and created a database that belonged to the User. After I tackled the API, I moved on to my front end and created the user authentication and other browser functionality for the User. I had some problems with my event handlers for creating new restaurants, however, I was able to move past this issue. Overall, I have learned a lot from collaboration with other peers in my course and from my instructors.

Unsolved Issues:

-I would love to be able to have the User be able to see all the restaurants that every user has made, and then like and/or save restaurants/bars to use in the future when making plans to "hang-out" in Boston. In addition, the CSS on my page needs more love and attention. In the future, I hope to be able to spend more time on making my page look more User friendly.
